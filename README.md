# Retail Data Intelligence  
*Business-Focused Retail Analytics with Python, SQL, and Power BI*

## 📌 Project Overview
Retail Data Intelligence is a business analytics project combining:

- API-based data extraction (Eurostat)
- SQL data modeling (DuckDB)
- Python OOP pipelines for ETL, feature engineering, and light ML
- KPI-driven business insights
- Time-series analysis and demand forecasting
- Power BI dashboard for retail performance monitoring

The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and applied machine learning skills relevant for Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Applied Machine Learning roles.

## 🎯 Objectives

### Business & Analytics
- Analyse European retail and consumer trends using real data
- Create KPI dashboards (sales, seasonality, growth)
- Build insights for pricing, demand patterns, and category performance

### Technical
- Implement a reproducible Python pipeline (OOP + modular structure)
- Integrate SQL workflows using DuckDB
- Implement clustering and forecasting as light, interpretable ML components
- Design a clean, interactive Power BI report
